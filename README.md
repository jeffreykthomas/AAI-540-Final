# Emotions AI
## Recognition in Text Using GoEmotions
### AAI-540-Final
### Cesar Lucero Ortiz, Jeffrey Thomas, and Ruben Velarde

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying a range of emotions in text inputs. Leveraging the GoEmotions dataset, which encompasses a diverse set of emotional labels, our model strives to accurately recognize and categorize emotions expressed in textual data. The final model is integrated into a Slack application, providing users with the ability to analyze text for emotional content directly within Slack.

### Dataset
The project uses the GoEmotions dataset, developed by Google Research. It is a comprehensive dataset consisting of 58k carefully curated Reddit comments, labeled for 27 emotion categories or Neutral.

### Model Development
The model development involves preprocessing the GoEmotions dataset, training a machine learning model to categorize emotions, and validating its performance. We use various NLP techniques and neural network architectures to achieve high accuracy and reliability.

### Slack App Deployment
The final model is deployed as a Slack app. This app allows users to input text and receive an emotion analysis, making it a useful tool for gauging sentiment and emotional content in conversations or text snippets.

### Key Features
Emotion Analysis: The core functionality, where the app analyzes the emotion of the input text.
Interactive Interface: A user-friendly Slack app interface for easy usage.
Real-time Feedback: Immediate emotion analysis feedback within Slack.
